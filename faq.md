## Questions

### Course registration

- If you are on the registrar wait list, you must have room in your schedule to
  be added to CME211.
- If you experience any technical issues while registering, you must submit a
  HelpSU request.  Feel free to ask questions on Canvas.  Keep in mind that the
  teaching staff has no control over registration.

### Course prerequisites

The prerequisite for CME 211 in the bulletin is stated as "introductory
programming course equivalent to CS 106A or instructor consent". CME 211
is a fast paced course for computing skill useful in scientific and
engineering applications. It is not a good first course in computing or
programming. We assume that students have learned and practiced with
basic programming concepts and structures such as variables, functions,
loops, data structures, file input/output, encapsulation, and modularity
(in some programming language). We review these concepts for both Python
and C++. However, we have found that students without at least one
formal undergraduate computing course quickly become overwhelmed with
the pace of CME 211. A background of using MATLAB and/or Python as a
part of (non-programming focused) science and engineering coursework is
typically not sufficient for success in CME 211.
