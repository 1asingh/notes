## Questions

### The course is full. How can I get into the course?

Thanks for your interest in CME 211. The course is currently full, but we expect
some turnover. We recommend that interested students return here on September 22
for updated information. Course resources will be made available to all Stanford
students (see below).

**Key point:** if you are on the CME 211 waitlist, your schedule must
have enough open units to be moved off of the waitlist if a spot opens.
The following is an excerpt from an older version of the Stanford
Bulletin:

*The waitlist process acts the same way for undergraduates and graduate
students. If the student exceeds the maximum unit load or has a class
time conflict the student will NOT be enrolled in the course and skipped
over for the next student. Please see the ExploreDegrees page below
regarding amount of work. If the graduate student exceeds 24 units with
the enrollment of the waitlist course, he/she would not be enrolled (or
if a class time conflict).*

### Course capacity

CME 211 is currently capped at 69 spots. We have a number students on an
internal waitlist because of a registrar error. There are 2 students on
the waitlist count shown on the [*Stanford
Bulletin*](http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=cme211&collapse=).
The waitlist is currently closed. We expect final capacity to be
somewhere around 90 students. If you would like to be in CME 211 please
check this FAQ for updated information on September 26. We will have
more information as we get closer to the start of the quarter.

### Registrar error?

In mid-August, the registrar accidentally removed the course capacity.
This moved roughly 38 students from the waitlist into the course. To fix
this error, those students had to be removed from the course. We are
keeping a list of the removed students and will contact them manually
with a code to enter the course when spaces open up.

### I can’t get on the waitlist

The waitlist is closed as of 2016-08-24.  There is no way to get on the waitlist
through Axess.

~~A few students seem to be experiencing problems enrolling on the CME
211 waitlist through Axess. If this is happening to you, please file a
[*HelpSU request*](https://helpsu.stanford.edu/helpsu/3.0/helpsu-form).
We are not able to diagnose these issues.~~

~~As long as there is space on the waitlist, students should be able to
get on it. On Wednesday August 3, there were 16 waitlisted students of
the 30 spots for wait listing.~~

### Course resources

Lecture screencasts and notes will be made available to all Stanford
students. Please check the [*CME211
homepage*](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cme211/) at the start of Fall
quarter 2016 for links.

### Course prerequisites

The prerequisite for CME 211 in the bulletin is stated as “introductory
programming course equivalent to CS 106A or instructor consent”. CME 211
is a fast paced course for computing skill useful in scientific and
engineering applications. It is not a good first course in computing or
programming. We assume that students have learned and practiced with
basic programming concepts and structures such as variables, functions,
loops, data structures, file input/output, encapsulation, and modularity
(in some programming language). We review these concepts for both Python
and C++. However, we have found that students without at least one
formal undergraduate computing course quickly become overwhelmed with
the pace of CME 211. A background of using MATLAB and/or Python as a
part of (non-programming focused) science and engineering coursework is
typically not sufficient for success in CME 211.
