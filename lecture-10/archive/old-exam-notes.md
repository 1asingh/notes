    * You may not use Google or any other search method to try and find answers

Topics:

* Understanding of low level and high level programming languages
* Use cases for fundamental data types: integers, floating point numbers,
  strings
* basic Python syntax: loops, conditionals, functions, variables
* built-in Python containers: lists, dictionaries, sets
* fundamentals of python's data model
* Python OOP: defining classes, data attributes, methods
* Basics of complexity analysis (as covered in lecture)

Book chapters:

  than that, we won't test on module stuff.
* We won't test on python exceptions
* We won't test on Numpy, Scipy, or matplotlib (which we cover this week)
