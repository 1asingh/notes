# CME 211 -- Exam 1 -- Python

Updated on 2017-10-20.

The exam will be conducted through Canvas. The exam will be available from the
morning of Wednesday 10/25 to Friday 10/27 at 2pm. Students will have 2 hours to
complete the exam once it is started. There will be several multiple choice
questions and a series of coding questions. At the end of the exam, you will be
asked to submit a single `*.py` file through Canvas. This is the file that we
will execute and evaluate.

Note: the exam will appear in the "Quizzes" section on Canvas.

Sample quiz solutions from 2013, 2014, and 2015 are posted on Canvas.

## Details

* Exam will be challenging -- I believe you all to be smart and hardworking
  students no matter how you perform on the exam
* I recommend attacking the problems in the given sequence
* Make sure to use your time wisely
* In terms of grading: correctness > performance (complexity) > style
* Remember, this exam is only worth 12.5% of your grade

## Rules

* Open book
* Open note
* Open computer (restricted internet use)
  * you may use Python 3 interpreter
  * you may use Jupyter Notebook
  * your may use computer to access notes at <https://github.com/CME211/notes>
  * your may use computer to access Learning Python book
  * your may use computer to access Python documentation
    @ [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
  * You may use the search bar on the Python docs page.
  * **You may not use Google or any other search method to try and find
    answers**
  * **Stackoverflow.com and similar QA sites are not allowed**
* Code must be Python 3
* You may use any functionality from
  the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
* **You may not use any external package (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, ...)**

## Communication

* When the exam gets published on Canvas on the morning of Wednesday 10/26, it
  will be known as **The-Exam-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named**. That is, nobody is
  allowed to discuss any aspect of the exam until Friday 10/28 at 2pm.
* The teaching staff will not answer any questions related to the exam until it
  is over. I have tried to remove all ambiguity from the question statements.
  The teaching staff will review the questions. If you feel something is
  ambiguous on the exam, please make a comment above your answer in the source
  code you submit. Indicate what you thought was ambiguous and the decision you
  made to resolve the ambiguity.
* If Canvas stops working during your exam for some reason, please email the
  required source code to <cme211-staff@lists.stanford.edu>. We will check the
  time stamp of the email against the start time stamp on Canvas.

## Topics

* Understanding of low level and high level programming languages
* Use cases for fundamental data types: integers, floating point numbers,
  strings
* basic Python syntax: loops, conditionals, functions, variables
* built-in Python containers: lists, dictionaries, sets
* fundamentals of python's data model
* Python OOP: defining classes, data attributes, methods
* Basics of complexity analysis (as covered in lecture notes)
