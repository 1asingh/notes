# CME 211 -- Exam 1 -- Python
Updated on 2018-10-22.

The exam will be conducted through Canvas. The exam will be available from the
morning of Thursday 10/25 to Friday 10/26 at 4:30 pm. Students will have approximately three
hours to
complete the exam once it is started. This year's exam will consist primarily of
applied programming questions. The main submissions will be a single `.py` script alongside
a `README` file containing responses to short-answer questions.

Note: We anticipate the exam will appear in the "Quizzes" section on Canvas.

## Details

* Exam should be challenging -- I believe you all to be smart and hardworking
  students no matter how you perform on the exam
* I recommend attacking the problems in the given sequence
* Make sure to use your time wisely
* In terms of grading: correctness > performance (complexity) > style
* Remember, this exam is only worth 12.5% of your grade

## Rules

* Open book
* Open note
* Open computer (restricted internet use)
  * you may use Python 3 interpreter
  * you may use Jupyter Notebook
  * your may use computer to access notes at <https://github.com/CME211/notes>
  * your may use computer to access Learning Python book
  * your may use computer to access Python documentation
    @ [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
  * You may use the search bar on the Python docs page.
  * **You may not use Google or any other search method to try and find
    answers**
  * **Stackoverflow.com and similar QA sites are not allowed**
* Code must be Python 3
* You may use any functionality from
  the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
* **You may not use any external package (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, ...)**

## Communication

* When the exam gets published on Canvas on the morning of Thursday 10/25, it
  will be known as **The-Exam-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named**. That is, nobody is
  allowed to discuss any aspect of the exam until Friday 10/26 after 4:30 pm.
* The teaching staff will not answer any questions related to the exam until it
  is over. We have tried to remove all ambiguity from the question statements.
  The teaching staff will review the questions. If you feel something is
  ambiguous on the exam, please make a comment above your answer in the source
  code you submit. Indicate what you thought was ambiguous and the decision you
  made to resolve the ambiguity.
* Your submission will take place through Git, as specified in the exam instructions.

## Topics

* Understanding of low level and high level programming languages
* Use cases for fundamental data types: integers, floating point numbers,
  strings
* basic Python syntax: loops, conditionals, functions, variables
* built-in Python containers: lists, dictionaries, sets
* fundamentals of python's data model
* Python OOP: defining classes, data attributes, methods
* Basics of complexity analysis (as covered in lecture notes)

## Relevant Book chapters

From *Learning Python*:

* Chapter 5: Numeric Types
* Chapter 6: The Dynamic Typing Interlude (i.e. references and objects)
* Chapter 7: String Fundamentals
* Chapter 8: Lists and Dictionaries
* Chapter 9: Tuples, Files, and Everything Else
* Chapter 11: Assignments, Expressions, and Prints

* Chapter 27: Class Coding Basics

## Notes

* If you want `sqrt()`, remember to `import math` and use `math.sqrt()`.
* We won't test on Numpy, Scipy, or matplotlib
