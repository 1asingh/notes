The exam will be accessible through Canvas, starting from Thursday October 15th at 12:00 A.M. through the same day at 11:59 P.M.; once the exam has been opened, students will have 1.5 hours to
complete the exam. The content of the exam will cover material from the start of chte course through Data Representation in lecture 7. There will be some short answer questions on data types and data structures, as well as programming problem(s).
The main submissions will be a single `.py` script alongside
a `README` file containing responses to short-answer questions.

## Details

* The exam should be challenging -- I believe you all to be smart and hardworking
  students no matter how you perform on the exam!
* Make sure to use your time wisely.
* In terms of grading: correctness > performance (complexity) > style.
* Remember, this exam is only worth a small part of your grade.

## Rules

* Open book
* Open note
* Open computer
  * you may use Python 3 interpreter
  * your may use computer to access notes at <https://github.com/CME211/notes>
  * your may use computer to access Learning Python book
  * your may use computer to access Python documentation
    @ [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
  * You may use the search bar on the Python docs page.
  * "Permitted informational resources only includes material a reasonable student would have found to be helpful when trying to understand class material or preparing for an assignment or exam. This does not include material that becomes useful once the assignment or exam begins and questions are known."
  * "In all cases, it is not permissible for students to enter exam questions into any software, apps, or websites. Accessing resources that directly explain how to answer questions from the actual assignment or exam is a violation of the Honor Code."
  * "Answers to assignment or exam questions must be written in the studentâ€™s own words, or else be cited, otherwise it is plagiarism. Use of all sources, including internet resources, must be cited. Similarly, consulting or collaborating with other people is not permitted and does not fall within the definition of an open-book or informational resource..."

* Code must be Python 3
* You may use any functionality from
  the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
* **You may not use any external package (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, ...)**

## Communication

* When the exam gets published on Canvas on the morning of Thursday 10/15, it
  will be known as **The-Exam-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named**. That is, nobody is
  allowed to discuss any aspect of the exam until Friday 10/16.
* The teaching staff will not answer any questions related to the exam until it
  is over. We have tried to remove all ambiguity from the question statements.
  The teaching staff will review the questions. If you feel something is
  ambiguous on the exam, please make a comment above your answer in the source
  code you submit. Indicate what you thought was ambiguous and the decision you
  made to resolve the ambiguity.
* Your submission will take place through Git, as specified in the exam instructions. The submission medium is the same as how you've been submitting your homeworks, so there should be no surprises.

## Topics

* Understanding of low level and high level programming languages
* Use cases for fundamental data types: integers, floating point numbers,
  strings
* basic Python syntax: loops, conditionals, functions, variables
* built-in Python containers: lists, dictionaries, sets
* fundamentals of python's data model
* Python OOP: defining classes, data attributes, methods
* Basics of complexity analysis (as covered in lecture notes)

## Relevant Book chapters

* Chapter 5: Numeric Types
* Chapter 6: The Dynamic Typing Interlude (i.e. references and objects)

## Notes

* If you want `sqrt()`, remember to `import math` and use `math.sqrt()`.
* We won't test on Numpy, Scipy, or matplotlib
